/**
 * A {@link Map} that further provides a <em>total ordering</em> on its keys.
 * The map is ordered according to the {@linkplain Comparable natural
 * ordering} of its keys, or by a {@link Comparator} typically
 * provided at sorted map creation time.  This order is reflected when
 * iterating over the sorted map's collection views (returned by the
 * {@code entrySet}, {@code keySet} and {@code values} methods).
 * Several additional operations are provided to take advantage of the
 * ordering.  (This interface is the map analogue of {@link SortedSet}.)
 *
 * <p>All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the {@code Comparable}
 * interface (or be accepted by the specified comparator).  Furthermore, all
 * such keys must be <em>mutually comparable</em>: {@code k1.compareTo(k2)} (or
 * {@code comparator.compare(k1, k2)}) must not throw a
 * {@code ClassCastException} for any keys {@code k1} and {@code k2} in
 * the sorted map.  Attempts to violate this restriction will cause the
 * offending method or constructor invocation to throw a
 * {@code ClassCastException}.
 *
 * <p>Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an
 * explicit comparator is provided) must be <em>consistent with equals</em> if
 * the sorted map is to correctly implement the {@code Map} interface.  (See
 * the {@code Comparable} interface or {@code Comparator} interface for a
 * precise definition of <em>consistent with equals</em>.)  This is so because
 * the {@code Map} interface is defined in terms of the {@code equals}
 * operation, but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its
 * {@code compareTo} (or {@code compare}) method, so two keys that are
 * deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map,
 * equal.  The behavior of a tree map <em>is</em> well-defined even if its
 * ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general
 * contract of the {@code Map} interface.
 *
 * <p>All general-purpose sorted map implementation classes should provide four
 * "standard" constructors. It is not possible to enforce this recommendation
 * though as required constructors cannot be specified by interfaces. The
 * expected "standard" constructors for all sorted map implementations are:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A void (no arguments) constructor, which creates an empty sorted map
 *   sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys.</li>
 *   <li>A constructor with a single argument of type {@code Comparator}, which
 *   creates an empty sorted map sorted according to the specified comparator.</li>
 *   <li>A constructor with a single argument of type {@code Map}, which creates
 *   a new map with the same key-value mappings as its argument, sorted
 *   according to the keys' natural ordering.</li>
 *   <li>A constructor with a single argument of type {@code SortedMap}, which
 *   creates a new sorted map with the same key-value mappings and the same
 *   ordering as the input sorted map.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note</strong>: several methods return submaps with restricted key
 * ranges. Such ranges are <em>half-open</em>, that is, they include their low
 * endpoint but not their high endpoint (where applicable).  If you need a
 * <em>closed range</em> (which includes both endpoints), and the key type
 * allows for calculation of the successor of a given key, merely request
 * the subrange from {@code lowEndpoint} to
 * {@code successor(highEndpoint)}.  For example, suppose that {@code m}
 * is a map whose keys are strings.  The following idiom obtains a view
 * containing all of the key-value mappings in {@code m} whose keys are
 * between {@code low} and {@code high}, inclusive:<pre>
 *   SortedMap&lt;String, V&gt; sub = m.subMap(low, high+"\0");</pre>
 *
 * A similar technique can be used to generate an <em>open range</em>
 * (which contains neither endpoint).  The following idiom obtains a
 * view containing all of the key-value mappings in {@code m} whose keys
 * are between {@code low} and {@code high}, exclusive:<pre>
 *   SortedMap&lt;String, V&gt; sub = m.subMap(low+"\0", high);</pre>
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.

 * 提供了几个附加操作以利用订购。（此接口是｛@link SortedSet｝的地图模拟。）
 *
 * <p>插入排序映射的所有键必须实现｛@code Comparable｝接口（或被指定的比较器接受）。
 * 此外，所有这样的键都必须是<em>相互可比的</em>：｛
 * @code k1.compareTo（k2）｝（或｛@code comparetor.compare（k1，k2）}）
 * 不能为排序映射中的任何键｛@code k1｝和｛@code k2｝抛出｛@code ClassCastException｝。
 * 尝试违反此限制将导致有问题的方法或构造函数调用引发｛@code ClassCastException｝。
 *
 * <p>请注意，如果排序映射要正确实现｛@code map｝接口，则排序映射维护的顺序（无论是否提供显式比较器）必须<em>与等于</em>一致。（
 * 请参见｛@code Comparable｝接口或｛@code Comparator｝接口，以获得与equals＜/em＞一致的＜em＞的精确定义。）之所以如此，
 * 是因为｛@code Map｝接口是根据｛@code equals｝操作定义的，
 * 但排序的映射使用其｛@code compareTo｝（或｛@code compare｝）方法执行所有键比较，
 * 因此该方法认为相等的两个键是，从排序地图的观点来看，相等。
 * 树映射<em>的行为是</em>定义良好的，即使其排序与等于不一致；它只是未能遵守｛@code Map｝接口的一般约定。
 *
 * <p>所有通用排序映射实现类都应该提供我们的“标准”构造函数。
 * 无法执行此建议尽管接口不能指定所需的构造函数。所有排序映射实现的预期“标准”构造函数为：
 *
 * <li>一个void（无参数）构造函数，它创建一个空的排序映射，根据其键的自然顺序进行排序</li>
 * <li>具有｛@code Comparator｝类型的单个参数的构造函数，该构造函数创建一个根据指定的比较器排序的空排序映射。/li>
 * <li>具有｛@code Map｝类型的单个参数的构造函数，它创建一个新的映射，该映射具有与其参数相同的键值映射，并根据键的自然顺序进行排序</li>
 * <li>具有｛@code SortedMap｝类型的单个参数的构造函数，它创建一个新的排序映射，该映射具有与输入排序映射相同的键值映射和相同的排序</li>
