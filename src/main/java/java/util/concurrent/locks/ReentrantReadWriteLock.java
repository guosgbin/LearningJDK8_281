/**
 * An implementation of {@link ReadWriteLock} supporting similar
 * semantics to {@link ReentrantLock}.
 * <p>This class has the following properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Acquisition order</b>
 *
 * <p>This class does not impose a reader or writer preference
 * ordering for lock access.  However, it does support an optional
 * <em>fairness</em> policy.
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt><b><i>Non-fair mode (default)</i></b>
 * <dd>When constructed as non-fair (the default), the order of entry
 * to the read and write lock is unspecified, subject to reentrancy
 * constraints.  A nonfair lock that is continuously contended may
 * indefinitely postpone one or more reader or writer threads, but
 * will normally have higher throughput than a fair lock.
 *
 * <dt><b><i>Fair mode</i></b>
 * <dd>When constructed as fair, threads contend for entry using an
 * approximately arrival-order policy. When the currently held lock
 * is released, either the longest-waiting single writer thread will
 * be assigned the write lock, or if there is a group of reader threads
 * waiting longer than all waiting writer threads, that group will be
 * assigned the read lock.
 *
 * <p>A thread that tries to acquire a fair read lock (non-reentrantly)
 * will block if either the write lock is held, or there is a waiting
 * writer thread. The thread will not acquire the read lock until
 * after the oldest currently waiting writer thread has acquired and
 * released the write lock. Of course, if a waiting writer abandons
 * its wait, leaving one or more reader threads as the longest waiters
 * in the queue with the write lock free, then those readers will be
 * assigned the read lock.
 *
 * <p>A thread that tries to acquire a fair write lock (non-reentrantly)
 * will block unless both the read lock and write lock are free (which
 * implies there are no waiting threads).  (Note that the non-blocking
 * {@link ReadLock#tryLock()} and {@link WriteLock#tryLock()} methods
 * do not honor this fair setting and will immediately acquire the lock
 * if it is possible, regardless of waiting threads.)
 * <p>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <li><b>Reentrancy</b>
 *
 * <p>This lock allows both readers and writers to reacquire read or
 * write locks in the style of a {@link ReentrantLock}. Non-reentrant
 * readers are not allowed until all write locks held by the writing
 * thread have been released.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, a writer can acquire the read lock, but not
 * vice-versa.  Among other applications, reentrancy can be useful
 * when write locks are held during calls or callbacks to methods that
 * perform reads under read locks.  If a reader tries to acquire the
 * write lock it will never succeed.
 *
 * <li><b>Lock downgrading</b>
 * <p>Reentrancy also allows downgrading from the write lock to a read lock,
 * by acquiring the write lock, then the read lock and then releasing the
 * write lock. However, upgrading from a read lock to the write lock is
 * <b>not</b> possible.
 *
 * <li><b>Interruption of lock acquisition</b>
 * <p>The read lock and write lock both support interruption during lock
 * acquisition.
 *
 * <li><b>{@link Condition} support</b>
 * <p>The write lock provides a {@link Condition} implementation that
 * behaves in the same way, with respect to the write lock, as the
 * {@link Condition} implementation provided by
 * {@link ReentrantLock#newCondition} does for {@link ReentrantLock}.
 * This {@link Condition} can, of course, only be used with the write lock.
 *
 * <p>The read lock does not support a {@link Condition} and
 * {@code readLock().newCondition()} throws
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 *
 * <li><b>Instrumentation</b>
 * <p>This class supports methods to determine whether locks
 * are held or contended. These methods are designed for monitoring
 * system state, not for synchronization control.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample usages</b>. Here is a code sketch showing how to perform
 * lock downgrading after updating a cache (exception handling is
 * particularly tricky when handling multiple locks in a non-nested
 * fashion):
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class CachedData {
 *   Object data;
 *   volatile boolean cacheValid;
 *   final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *
 *   void processCachedData() {
 *     rwl.readLock().lock();
 *     if (!cacheValid) {
 *       // Must release read lock before acquiring write lock
 *       rwl.readLock().unlock();
 *       rwl.writeLock().lock();
 *       try {
 *         // Recheck state because another thread might have
 *         // acquired write lock and changed state before we did.
 *         if (!cacheValid) {
 *           data = ...
 *           cacheValid = true;
 *         }
 *         // Downgrade by acquiring read lock before releasing write lock
 *         rwl.readLock().lock();
 *       } finally {
 *         rwl.writeLock().unlock(); // Unlock write, still hold read
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 *     try {
 *       use(data);
 *     } finally {
 *       rwl.readLock().unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * ReentrantReadWriteLocks can be used to improve concurrency in some
 * uses of some kinds of Collections. This is typically worthwhile
 * only when the collections are expected to be large, accessed by
 * more reader threads than writer threads, and entail operations with
 * overhead that outweighs synchronization overhead. For example, here
 * is a class using a TreeMap that is expected to be large and
 * concurrently accessed.
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class RWDictionary {
 *   private final Map<String, Data> m = new TreeMap<String, Data>();
 *   private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *   private final Lock r = rwl.readLock();
 *   private final Lock w = rwl.writeLock();
 *
 *   public Data get(String key) {
 *     r.lock();
 *     try { return m.get(key); }
 *     finally { r.unlock(); }
 *   }
 *   public String[] allKeys() {
 *     r.lock();
 *     try { return m.keySet().toArray(); }
 *     finally { r.unlock(); }
 *   }
 *   public Data put(String key, Data value) {
 *     w.lock();
 *     try { return m.put(key, value); }
 *     finally { w.unlock(); }
 *   }
 *   public void clear() {
 *     w.lock();
 *     try { m.clear(); }
 *     finally { w.unlock(); }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
 *
 * <p>This lock supports a maximum of 65535 recursive write locks
 * and 65535 read locks. Attempts to exceed these limits result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
 *
 * @since 1.5

/**
 * 此类具有以下属性：
 * 采购订单
 * 此类不会为锁访问强加读取器或写入器的优先顺序。但是，它确实支持可选的公平策略。
 * 非公平模式（默认）
 * 当构造为非公平（默认）时，进入读写锁的顺序是未指定的，受重入约束。持续竞争的非公平锁可能会无限期地推迟一个或多个读取器或写入器线程，但通常比公平锁具有更高的吞吐量。
 * 公平模式
 * 当构造为公平时，线程使用近似到达顺序策略竞争进入。当当前持有的锁被释放时，要么为等待时间最长的单个写入线程分配写入锁，要么如果有一组读取线程等待的时间比所有等待写入线程的时间长，则为该组分配读取锁。
 * 如果持有写锁或存在等待写入线程，则尝试获取公平读锁（不可重入）的线程将阻塞。直到当前等待的最早的写线程获得并释放写锁之后，该线程才会获得读锁。当然，如果一个等待的写入者放弃它的等待，留下一个或多个读取线程作为队列中最长的等待者并且没有写入锁，那么这些读取器将被分配读取锁。
 * 除非读锁和写锁都空闲（这意味着没有等待的线程），否则试图获取公平写锁（不可重入）的线程将阻塞。 （请注意，非阻塞ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.tryLock()和ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock.tryLock()方法不遵守此公平设置，如果可能，将立即获取锁，而不管等待线程。）
 *
 * 重入
 * 此锁允许读取器和写入器以ReentrantLock的样式重新获取读取或写入锁。在写线程持有的所有写锁都被释放之前，不允许非重入读者。
 * 此外，写入者可以获取读锁，但反之则不行。在其他应用程序中，当在调用或回调在读锁下执行读取的方法期间持有写锁时，重入可能很有用。如果读者试图获取写锁，它将永远不会成功。
 * 锁定降级
 * 重入还允许从写锁降级为读锁，方法是获取写锁，然后是读锁，然后释放写锁。但是，无法从读锁升级到写锁。
 * 锁获取中断
 * 读锁和写锁都支持获取锁时的中断。
 * Condition支持
 * 写锁提供了一个Condition实现，就写锁而言，它的行为方式与ReentrantLock.newCondition提供的Condition实现对ReentrantLock的行为方式相同。当然，这个Condition只能与写锁一起使用。
 * 读锁不支持Condition并且readLock().newCondition()抛出UnsupportedOperationException 。
 * 仪器仪表
 * 此类支持确定锁是否被持有或竞争的方法。这些方法是为监视系统状态而设计的，而不是为同步控制而设计的。
 * 此类的序列化与内置锁的行为方式相同：反序列化锁处于未锁定状态，无论其在序列化时的状态如何。
 * 示例用法。这是一个代码草图，展示了如何在更新缓存后执行锁降级（以非嵌套方式处理多个锁时，异常处理特别棘手）：
